# Tutorial-to-switch-to-dark-mode
This repository contains a very basic example of converting light mode to dark mode with the help of JavaScript, HTML and CSS

TIP :- 
The class you make to change the mode is not declare in html code but they should be in .CSS file 
and use ur javascript code to add or remove that files 
if the classes are in html code then they didn't remove when you toggled in they remain add always...
for example 
you want to change the color of background to black after the toggling
then write that class in .css file only and toggle them with .js only
do not add in html code 
<h1 class = "color-after-switch color-before-switch" >
  (DO NOT ADD THE AFTER SWITCH CLASS)
<h1 class = "color-before-switch" > (LIKE THIS ONLY)
